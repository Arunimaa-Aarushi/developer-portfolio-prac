            <h3>A High-School Student</h3>
            <p class="top">A student's work is not only studying. Even while studying, I found a way to pursue my passion for
                web-development and working hard to achieve my dreams. I hope one day alongside as a student, I'll also
                work
                as a Web Developer.I hope it's not too much to ask.
            </p>
