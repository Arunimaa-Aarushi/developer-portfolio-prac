            <h3>A High-School Student</h3>
            <p class="top">A student's work is not only studying. Even while studying, I found a way to pursue my
                passion for
                web-development and working hard to achieve my dreams. I hope one day alongside as a student, I'll also
                work
                as a Web Developer.I hope it's not too much to ask.

                easily. But with the help pf my mentor, it took me no time.I hope very soon I'll be able to work as a
                Web-developer. </p>
